# Supported input data formats

For structure charts, Genesis supports the output of the admixture and CLUMPP programs. In addition, we provide a python script that will convert the output of the structure program into the appropriate input format. See See[**Creating Structure Plots**](./admixture/index.md).

For PCA charts, Genesis supports the output of the eigenstrat and plink programs and the SNPRelate R package. In addition, we provide Python scripts that will convert the output of the fastpca program into the appropriate format. See See [**Creating PCA Plots**](./pca/index.md).

We shall try to add to the suite of conversion scripts, but we intend that future versions of Genesis will automatically detect the correct input format and deal appropriately.
